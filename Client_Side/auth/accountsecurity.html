    <h1>Account Security Guide</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Shun Resort! Keeping your account safe is important to us. Follow these simple tips to protect your account and personal information.</p>

    <h2>1. Use a Strong Password</h2>
    <p>Create a unique password that includes a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using easily guessed words like your name or birthday.</p>

    <h2>2. Don’t Share Your Login Details</h2>
    <p>Never share your password or verification code with anyone. Shun Resort staff will never ask for your password via email or chat.</p>

    <h2>3. Watch Out for Suspicious Emails</h2>
    <p>If you receive an unexpected email asking for personal details or claiming to be from Shun Resort, do not click any links. Always check the sender’s address carefully.</p>

    <h2>4. Keep Your Device Secure</h2>
    <p>Make sure your computer or mobile device has updated antivirus software and avoid using public Wi-Fi when logging into your account.</p>

    <h2>5. Reset Your Password Regularly</h2>
    <p>Change your password every few months to keep your account secure. If you think someone else might have access, reset it immediately.</p>

    <h2>6. Contact Support If You Notice Anything Strange</h2>
    <p>If you suspect any unauthorized access or suspicious activity on your account, contact Shun Resort support right away for assistance.</p>
